## 🏗️ The Academic Structure of a Research Title

A high-quality research title typically follows this 4-part structure:
1.  **The Subject (What):** The system or concept (e.g., "Integrated Decision Support System").
2.  **The Methodology (How):** The technology used (e.g., "AI-Driven," "Machine Learning & Deep Learning").
3.  **The Variables (Key Features):** What is being measured/done (e.g., "Crop Recommendation," "Disease Diagnosis").
4.  **The Context (Where/Who):** The target audience or ecosystem (e.g., "Sustainable Agricultural Ecosystem," "Small-scale Farming Communities").

## 🏆 Recommended Comprehensive Title

> **"Towards a Sustainable Agricultural Ecosystem: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of an Integrated Intelligence-Based Decision Support System incorporating ML-Driven Crop Selection, Deep Learning Disease Diagnosis, and a Community-Centric Expert Knowledge Exchange Platform."**

### Why this works:
- **Comprehensive:** It covers all components: the recommendation engine, the disease detector, and the new community features.
- **Academic Rigor:** Uses terms like "Design, Implementation, and Evaluation," which implies a full research cycle.
- **Impact-Oriented:** Starts with the goal ("Sustainable Agricultural Ecosystem").
